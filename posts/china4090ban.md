The unexpected removal of the NVIDIA RTX 4090 from their website in China has sent shockwaves through the PC hardware industry. With its TPP exceeding 4800 and its status as the best GPU currently available, enthusiasts, PC builders, and professionals alike were startled after the news broke out. The move to limit sales with AI GPUs has left many questioning NVIDIA's strategy and has opened the door for their competitor, AMD, to gain ground with their Radeon RX 7900 XTX.

As the market adjusts to this unexpected development, all eyes are now on NVIDIA's upcoming 5000 series, which is rumored to be released in late 2024 to early 2025. Will the new lineup be able to reclaim NVIDIA's position as the top choice for GPU enthusiasts? Or will AMD's recent successes continue to destroy NVIDIA's market share in China?

The future of the GPU industry is uncertain, with both NVIDIA and AMD fighting for dominance in a quickly evolving landscape. As consumers eagerly await the next generation of GPUs, only time will tell how this saga will unfold.
