I recently received a response from ASUS following my outreach to several companies. Their reply was quite standard but encouraging:

"Hello Adam,

Thank you for contacting ASUS Business to Business.
My name is Terence T., First and foremost, thank you for your patience while we completed our review and research of this issue. We apologize for the delay, and are grateful for the opportunity to continue to assist you.
We appreciate your interest in supporting our mission to provide innovative technology that creates an effortless and joyful digital life for everyone! To be considered for becoming an ASUS partner, or gaining ASUS sponsorship for your YouTube channel, please complete the online form at: https://www.asus.com/us/site/systems-reseller/. This form will go to our Business4Business division, which works with resellers and service providers directly. They will be able to assist you further.
If you have any further questions or concerns please respond back to this email."

This reply aligns with what I expected, considering my message to them:

"Dear ASUS Team,

I hope this email finds you at a great time! My name is Adam Ahmed, and I'm reaching out with a hopeful heart and a dream that aligns with the vision and excellence of ASUS. At just 13 years old, I've attempted and I am still trying on a journey in the gaming world through my Twitch channel (twitch.tv/rocketspot) and YouTube (youtube.com/@ttv_rocketspot), where I aim to share not just gameplay, but moments, victories, and the sheer joy that gaming and watching other people play brings. As a small streamer and content creator, it is hard to grow without something to grow with.

Currently, my dreams are greater than my capabilities. My setup, which consists of an Intel i7 4th Gen 4770K CPU and an Radeon RX 550 GPU in a Dell Optiplex, falls short of being able to play, let alone stream at a good quality, the games that my audience and I are most excited aboutâ€”Fortnite, Valorant, CS2, and others that define today's gaming society. This border not only restricts my content's potential but also my growth and ability to compete in the always changing gaming community.

This is where I hope ASUS could play a significant role. Your reputation for pushing the boundaries of technology and supporting the gaming community speaks for itself, and I believe a partnership could be beneficial. With your support, whether through sponsorship or by providing hardware upgrades, I could significantly enhance the quality of my content, explore a wider range of games, and offer engaging, high-quality streams that are loved by viewers worldwide.

In return, I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to showcase ASUS's products in action, highlighting their performance and how they empower gamers like me to achieve their dreams. I envision creating dedicated content that not only features your hardware but also educates my audience about the technology that powers their favorite games. This collaboration could serve as an example of how ASUS's commitment to quality and innovation can transform the gaming experience for small content creators and their audiences alike.

I understand the significance of this request and do not take the opportunity lightly. I am committed to making the most of the support by dedicating myself to improving my content, growing my audience, and proudly representing ASUS as a partner in the gaming community.

Thank you for considering my proposal. I am eager to discuss further how we can work together towards a successful partnership. Please feel free to contact me atadam@readisten.com for any more information or to arrange a conversation.

Looking forward to the possibility of joining forces with ASUS to make gaming dreams come true.

WIshing you well,

Adam Ahmed aka RocketSpot

Although there's nothing groundbreaking or exciting in ASUS's response, it's heartening to receive acknowledgment from such a known company. Terence's response, while formal, opened a gate for potential collaboration, which is an exciting thought.

In other news, I've been working on developing this blog website using Typescript and Deno.dev. However, I experienced a significant road block: the realization that my current code setup does not support SEO (Search Engine Optimization). For those who do not know, SEO is a crucial tool for enhancing the ranking of a website on search engines like Google. Its absence is a challenge in expanding my blog's reach. This setback has prompted me to explore alternative solutions or adjustments to my current setup.

Despite this, the tech community seems to be in a flatline, with no major developments or breakthroughs recently. Nevertheless, I remain committed to keeping up to date of any emerging trends or innovations.

All in all, today's experiences have been a mix of victories and learning opportunities. It's important to celebrate even minor progresses, like the response from ASUS, while also tackling the challenges, like the SEO issue.

Stay tuned for more updates, and remember, every day is a step forward in this always evolving technological universe.
